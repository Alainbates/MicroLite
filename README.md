* Extension support to quickly develop applications using [ASP.NET MVC](https://github.com/TrevorPilley/MicroLite.Extensions.Mvc#microliteextensionsmvc) and [WebApi](https://github.com/TrevorPilley/MicroLite.Extensions.WebApi#microliteextensionswebapi)
* Native support for Enum, Uri, and XDocument conversion
* An extensible pipeline which allows 'plugging in' custom [Type Converters](http://microliteorm.wordpress.com/type-converters/) or [Session Listeners](http://microliteorm.wordpress.com/listeners/)
