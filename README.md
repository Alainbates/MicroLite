MicroLite ORM Framework
=========

MicroLite is a small lightweight or "micro" object relational mapping framework for Microsoft .NET.

Although MicroLite currently only supports Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite, it offers a number of advantages over other micro ORM frameworks.

* It only references the .NET base class libraries.
* It supports .NET 3.5 and 4.0 client profile.
* It is easily injected.
* It is easy to test code which uses it.
* It supports extensions for logging etc
